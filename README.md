# About Me
- 👋 Hi, I’m Matthew!.
- 💻 Most of the projects I create are web applications.
- 🤖 The languages I use the most are Javascript, Python and Java, however I have some experience with C/C++, Haskel, Visual Basic, Solidity, Swift.
- 🌐 The main libraries/frameworks that I use are [p5.js](https://p5js.org), [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org), [express](https://expressjs.com), and [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org). I also use the Java coding environment [Processing](https://processing.org).

# What is on my profile
- My main attraction is my [website](https://github.com/RearedCape8319/website) which houses lots of [p5.js](https://p5js.org) sketches. These are mostly visualisations of various mathematical techniques or processes, but also contains some games. I used [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) and [express](https://expressjs.com) for the backend of my application.
- Another mention is my [Rock Paper Scissors](https://github.com/RearedCape8319/RockPaperScissors) game, which seconds as a RESTful API. The website has a full user interface, however the site can also be accessed through a command line using `curl`. I used [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) and [express](https://expressjs.com) for the backend of my application.
